# Take2: The Movie Recasting App

Take2 is the new time-killer for filmheads and movie buffs. Got a great idea for a remake? Think you could show one up on J.J. Abrams? With Take2, you can search for any movie, pull down its main cast list, and choose your ideal fantasy cast list for this movie. Once you submit your selection, your Recast will be displayed on the front page for others to admire and vote on.
